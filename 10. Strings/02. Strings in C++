-> Richer library
-> Supports operators like +, <, >, ==, <=, >= are possible
-> Can assign a string later
-> Can be converted to C-style if needed
-> It has functions like str.length(), str.substr(1,3), str.find("abc")
-> If we want to input a line with spaces then we have to use getline(cin,str) otherwise it will take only the first word
-> Shortcut for traversal of string
    for(char x:str)
        cout<<x;
