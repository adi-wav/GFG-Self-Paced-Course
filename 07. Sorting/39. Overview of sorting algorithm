1. Binary array: Partition(Lomuto, hoare, naive)
2. Array with three values: Partition(Lomuto, hoare, naive)
3. Array of size n and small ranged values: Counting sort
4. Array of size n and rainge is of size n2 or n3 or closer: Radix sort
5. Array of uniformly distributed data over a range: Bucket sort
6. When memory writes are costly: Selection sort or Cycle sort
7. When adjacent swaps are allowed: Bubble sort
8. When array size is small: Selection sort or Insertion sort(better)
9. When available extra memory is less: Shall sort[O(n*(logn)2)]

General purpose sorting algorithm:
    merge sort (divide and conquer)
    heap sort
    quick sort(fastest) (divide and conquer)
Hybrid algorithm:
    Tim sort (Insertion + merge)
    Intra sort (Insertion + heap + merge)
