1. Either size is fixed or pre-allocated(in both fixed and variable sized arrays), OR the worst case insertion at the end is theta(n)
2. Insertion in the middle(or beginning) is costly
3. Deletion in the middle(or beginning) is costly
4. Implementation of data structures like queue and dque is complex with arrays.

Problems with Arrays:
-> How to implement Round Robin Scheduling
-> Given a sequence of items whenever we see an item x in the sequence, we need to replace it with 5 instances of another item y
-> We have multiple sorted sequences and we need to merge them frequently
