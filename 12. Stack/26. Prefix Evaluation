1) Create an empty stack st.
2) Traverse through every symbol x of given prefix(from right to left).
    i) If x is an operand push to st.
    ii) Else (x is an operator)
        a) op1 = st.top(); st.pop();
        b) op2 = st.top(); st.pop();
        c) Compute op1 (x) op2 and push the result to st.
3) Return st.top()
(Traverse and when you hit an operator take the previous two operands and compute them and push back to stack.)
